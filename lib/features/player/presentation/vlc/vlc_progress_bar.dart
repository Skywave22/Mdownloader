/// The seek bar for the VLC engine.
///
/// Thin by design: it holds only the drag position, and renders through the
/// shared [PlayerScrubber], so the overlay cannot drift from the design the
/// other engine gets.
///
/// It listens to the controller directly rather than through Riverpod, so a
/// position tick rebuilds this widget and nothing above it.
///
/// A seek on its way: the controller keeps publishing the engine's own
/// position - a faked one would poison the resume point writer - and libVLC
/// reports the place it left until the new one has been reached and
/// refilled, which on a slow network file is seconds. The thumb shows the
/// controller's [VlcPlayerController.pendingSeekTarget] in its place, from
/// the moment any seek is asked for - this bar's, a double tap, a D-pad step,
/// the skip chip - until the engine arrives, the way Media3 and the browsers
/// report a seek. A slow one shows the spinner over a thumb that is still on
/// the target. Relative D-pad steps chain from the target as a side effect,
/// because the bar reads its start value from what is displayed.
